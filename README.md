In order to run the interface, you have to use the Microsoft VS CLR .NET Framework which is what we used to create the interface. For the best experience, run using the Debugger. Sometimes the interface may show as bugged when you initially open Microsoft Visual Studio: simply close and reopen the solution. Similarly, when you run the Debugger, sometimes the executable may automatically fail (from what we can tell it's a RAM thing), simply press Debugger again and it should run with no problems.
